<!-- 
This will be listings. Will come back to finish when I can. 

Card page, each a link to a student submission in `submissions/`.

Add an example to each of the four. Maybe make them their own menus, woth an instructions page, and then the submissions / share page that starts with 1-2 examples from the lectures that they can use as templates / starting points for their own assignments. Eahc one more challebing than the ones that came before. Maybe solo maybe not.  -->
