# Work on Assignment 1 in Class

You may complete the assignment individually or in groups of 2-3. If working collaboratively, each member must submit their own assignment with the groupâ€™s names listed in the author metadata above.

Steps to Complete the Assignment:

1. Create a free or student account ($5/month) with PositCloud.
2. Create a new workspace.
3. In the workspace, create a new project from a Github repository using this link: https://github.com/mclevey/3040-2025-assignment-1-posit.git.
4. Open assignment-1.qmd and update the author metadata at the top of the file.
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook, executing the code cells as you go. Note that one of the instructions asks you to insert a citation to the assigned reading. Citation information is already entered into the refs.bib file.
6. "Knit" your document to an HTML file. Make sure it executes without errors and preview the result.
7. Save the HTML file and upload it to the Dropbox on Brightspace.
