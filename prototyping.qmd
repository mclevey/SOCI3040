# Testing Galleries Idea

It's only a gallery when you click on an image. But remember you can group images into subplots. You could do this and make a gallery per week, so it's thematic... Shows development of skills over time.

Or if not per week, per major "Data Stories" assignments (stay on brand). For example: 

# Data Stories Assignment 1

::: {#fig-week-01-gallery layout-ncol=3 layout-valign="bottom"}
![This is a student assignment.](media/this-is-fine.jpg){group="3040-gallery"}

![This is also a student assignment.](media/telling-stories.png){group="3040-gallery"}

![This is also a student assignment.](media/data-visualization.jpg){group="3040-gallery"}

A selection of visualizations from the first data stories assignment. See all student submissions [here. (LINKS WORK! ðŸ¤˜)](https://www.johnmclevey.com).
:::

If the link above doesn't work (THEY DO! ðŸ¤˜), I can link to a gallery page for each assignment here, that includes the student submissions as cards highlighting the specific things I want in the card, and then expanding it to be their full reproducible notebook to build the visualization and tell the story. So they need to specify what their main image is when they submit their notebook. Then I add it to the folder and commit it and it goes live on the website and I have a directory of files I can grade. Even better if they post it on github somewhere and I can pull it in. 


# Data Stories Assignment 2

::: {#fig-week-01-gallery layout-ncol=3 layout-valign="bottom"}
![This is a student assignment.](media/this-is-fine.jpg){group="3040-gallery"}

![This is also a student assignment.](media/telling-stories.png){group="3040-gallery"}
