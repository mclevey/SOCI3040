    "text": "Alexander (2023) Telling Stories with Data\n\n“This is not another statistics book. It is much better than that. It is a book about doing quantitative research, about scientific justification, about quality control, about communication and epistemic humility. It’s a valuable supplement to any methods curriculum, and useful for self-learners as well.” – Richard McElreath\n\n\n\n\n\n“This clean and fun book covers a wide range of topics on statistical communication, programming, and modeling in a way that should be a useful supplement to any statistics course or self-learning program. I absolutely love this book!” – Andrew Gelman\n\n\n“Every data analyst has to tell stories with data, and yet traditional textbooks focus on statistical methods alone. Telling Stories with Data teaches the entire data science workflow, including data acquisition, communication, and reproducibility. I highly recommend this unique book!” – Kosuke Imai\n\n\n“Telling (true) Stories with Data requires more than fancy statistical models and big data. With a series of fascinating case studies, Rohan Alexander teaches us how to ask good questions, acquire data, estimate models, and communicate our results. This holistic approach is explained with crisp and engaging prose. The pages are filled with detailed R examples, which emphasize the importance of transparency and reproducibility. I absolutely love this book and recommend it to all my students.” – Vincent Arel-Bundock\n\n\n“An excellent book. Communication and reproducibility are of increasing concern in statistics, and this book covers these topics and more in a practical, appealing, and truly unique way.” – Daniela Witten",

By thoughtfully considering where we want to go, we stay focused and efficient, preventing aimless wandering and scope creep. Without a defined goal, any path will suffice, but we typically cannot afford to wander aimlessly. While our endpoint may change, having an initial objective allows for deliberate and reasoned adjustments. This planning doesn’t require extensive time—often just ten minutes with paper and pen can provide significant value."

Provides clear testing framework Ensures data meets expectations. “Almost free” with modern computing Provides “an intimate feeling for the situation” (Hamming [1997] 2020)\n\nSimulating data is the second step, forcing us into the details of our analysis by focusing on expected data structures and distributions. By creating simulated data, we define clear features that our real dataset should satisfy, aiding in data cleaning and preparation. For example, simulating an age-group variable with specific categories allows us to test the real data for consistency. Simulation is also vital for validating statistical models; by applying models to data with known properties, we can ensure they perform as intended before using them on real data. Since simulation is inexpensive and quick with modern computing resources, it provides “an intimate feeling for the situation” and helps build confidence in our analytical tools."

This phase can significantly affect statistical results, as the choices made determine the quality and usability of the data. Researchers may feel overwhelmed—either by having too little data, raising concerns about the feasibility of analysis, or by having too much data, making it difficult to manage and process. Careful consideration, thorough cleaning, and preparation at this stage are crucial for the success of subsequent analysis, ensuring that the data are suitable for the questions being asked."

This process typically starts with descriptive statistics and progresses to statistical modeling. It’s important to remember that statistical models are tools—not absolute truths—and they operate based on the instructions we provide. They help us understand the data more clearly but do not offer definitive results. At this stage, the models we develop are heavily influenced by prior decisions made during data acquisition and preparation. Sophisticated modelers understand that models are like the visible tip of an iceberg, reliant on the substantial groundwork laid in earlier stages. They recognize that modeling results are shaped by choices about data inclusion, measurement, and recording, reflecting broader aspects of the world even before data reach the workflow."

We aim to uncover something important, so it’s essential to document everything initially, even if other forms of communication supplement the written record later. Openness about the entire process—from data acquisition to analysis—builds credibility and ensures others can fully engage with and understand the work. Without clear communication, even excellent work can be overlooked or misunderstood. While the world may not always reward merit alone, thorough and transparent communication enhances the impact of our work, and achieving mastery in this area requires significant experience and practice."

As we delve deeper, each question we pose tends to generate additional questions, leading to continual improvement and refinement of our understanding. This iterative questioning contrasts with the traditional Popperian approach of fixed hypothesis testing often taught quantitative methods courses in the sciences; instead, questions evolve continuously throughout the exploration. Finding an initial research question can be challenging, especially when attempting to operationalize it into measurable and available variables.\nStrategies to overcome this include selecting an area of genuine interest, sketching broad claims that can be honed into specific questions, and combining insights from different fields. Developing comfort with the inherent messiness of real-world data allows us to ask new questions as the data evolve. Knowing a dataset in detail often reveals unexpected patterns or anomalies, which we can explore further with subject-matter experts. Becoming a “hybrid”—cultivating knowledge across various disciplines—and being comfortable with asking seemingly simple or “dumb” questions are particularly valuable in enhancing our understanding and fostering meaningful insights."

This process is challenging because even seemingly simple measurements, like a person’s height, can vary based on factors like the time of day or the tools used (e.g., tape measure versus laser), making consistent comparison difficult and often unfeasible. The difficulty intensifies with more abstract concepts such as sadness or pain, where defining and measuring them consistently is even more problematic. This reduction of the world into data is not value-free; it requires critical decisions about what to measure, how to measure it, and what to ignore, all influenced by context and purpose. Like Picasso’s minimalist drawings that capture the essence of a dog but lack details necessary for specific assessments (e.g., determining if the dog is sick), we must deeply understand and respect what we’re measuring, carefully deciding which features are essential and which can be stripped away to serve our research objectives."

Statistics is not merely a collection of dry theorems and proofs; it’s a way of exploring and understanding the world. A statistical model is not a rigid recipe to follow mechanically but a tool for making sense of data. Modeling is usually required to infer statistical patterns, formally known as statistical inference—the process of using data to infer the distribution that generated them. Importantly, statistical significance does not equate to scientific significance, and relying on arbitrary pass/fail tests is rarely appropriate. Instead, we should use statistical modeling as a form of echolocation, listening to what the models tell us about the shape of the world while recognizing that they offer just one representation of reality."

Our data are a simplification of the messy, complex world from which they were derived.  There are different approximations of “plausibly measurable”.

    "text": "6.2 How Do Our Worlds Become Data?\n Through skillfulreduction 👨‍🍳\n\nJust as a chef reduces a rich sauce to concentrate its essential flavors, we simplify reality into data—plausibly measurable approximations that capture the essence of the complex world. This reduction process involves deliberate choices about what aspects of reality to include, much like deciding which ingredients to emphasize in a culinary reduction. Our datasets, therefore, are distilled versions of reality, highlighting specific components while inevitably leaving out others.\nAs we employ statistical models to explore and understand these datasets, it’s crucial to recognize both what the data include and what they omit. Similar to how a reduction in cooking intensifies certain flavors while others may be lost or muted, the process of data simplification can inadvertently exclude important nuances or perspectives. Particularly in data science, where human-generated data are prevalent, we must consider who or what is systematically missing from our datasets. Some individuals or phenomena may not fit neatly into our chosen methods and might be oversimplified or excluded entirely. The abstraction and simplification inherent in turning the world into data require careful judgment—much like a chef monitoring a reduction to achieve the desired consistency without overcooking—to determine when simplification is appropriate and when it risks losing critical information.\nMeasurement itself presents significant challenges, and those deeply involved in the data collection process often have less trust in the data than those removed from it. Just as the process of reducing a sauce demands constant attention to prevent burning or altering the intended flavor, converting the world into data involves numerous decisions and potential errors—from selecting what to measure to deciding on the methods and accuracy required. Advances in instruments—from telescopes in astronomy to real-time internet data collection—have expanded our ability to gather data, much like new culinary techniques enhance a chef’s ability to create complex dishes. However, the world still imperfectly becomes data, and to truly learn from it, we must actively seek to understand the imperfections in our datasets and consider how our “reduction” process may have altered or omitted important aspects of reality."

As we delve deeper, each question we pose tends to generate additional questions, leading to continual improvement and refinement of our understanding. This iterative questioning contrasts with the traditional Popperian approach of fixed hypothesis testing often taught quantitative methods courses in the sciences; instead, questions evolve continuously throughout the exploration. Finding an initial research question can be challenging, especially when attempting to operationalize it into measurable and available variables.\nStrategies to overcome this include selecting an area of genuine interest, sketching broad claims that can be honed into specific questions, and combining insights from different fields. Developing comfort with the inherent messiness of real-world data allows us to ask new questions as the data evolve. Knowing a dataset in detail often reveals unexpected patterns or anomalies, which we can explore further with subject-matter experts. Becoming a “hybrid”—cultivating knowledge across various disciplines—and being comfortable with asking seemingly simple or “dumb” questions are particularly valuable in enhancing our understanding and fostering meaningful insights."

Time of day affects height. Different tools yield different results). More complex measurements are even harder. How do we measure happiness or pain?\n Measurement requires decisions and is not value-free. Context and purpose guide all measurement choices.\n\n\n\n\nPicasso’s dog and the challenges of reduction.\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement and data collection involve the complex task of deciding how to translate the vibrant, multifaceted world into quantifiable data. This process is challenging because even seemingly simple measurements, like a person’s height, can vary based on factors like the time of day or the tools used (e.g., tape measure versus laser), making consistent comparison difficult and often unfeasible. The difficulty intensifies with more abstract concepts such as sadness or pain, where defining and measuring them consistently is even more problematic. This reduction of the world into data is not value-free; it requires critical decisions about what to measure, how to measure it, and what to ignore, all influenced by context and purpose. Like Picasso’s minimalist drawings that capture the essence of a dog but lack details necessary for specific assessments (e.g., determining if the dog is sick), we must deeply understand and respect what we’re measuring, carefully deciding which features are essential and which can be stripped away to serve our research objectives."

Decisions such as whether to exclude “prefer not to say” responses (which would ignore certain participants) or how to categorize open-text entries (where merging them with other categories might disrespect respondents’ specific choices) have significant implications. There is no universally correct approach; choices depend on the context and purpose of the analysis. Therefore, it’s vital to meticulously record every step of the data cleaning process to ensure transparency and allow others to understand the decisions made. Ultimately, data do not speak for themselves; they reflect the interpretations and choices of those who prepare and analyze them."

It includes producing summary statistics, creating graphs and tables, and sometimes even preliminary modeling. EDA requires a variety of skills and never truly finishes, as there’s always more to explore. Although it’s challenging to delineate where EDA ends and formal statistical modeling begins—since our beliefs and understanding evolve continuously—EDA is foundational in shaping the story we tell about our data.

Statistics is not merely a collection of dry theorems and proofs; it’s a way of exploring and understanding the world. A statistical model is not a rigid recipe to follow mechanically but a tool for making sense of data. Modeling is usually required to infer statistical patterns, formally known as statistical inference—the process of using data to infer the distribution that generated them. Importantly, statistical significance does not equate to scientific significance, and relying on arbitrary pass/fail tests is rarely appropriate. Instead, we should use statistical modeling as a form of echolocation, listening to what the models tell us about the shape of the world while recognizing that they offer just one representation of reality."

If we knew perfectly how everything was affected by the uncountable factors that influence it, then we could forecast perfectly a coin toss, a dice roll, and every other seemingly random process each time. But we cannot. Instead, we must simplify things to that which is plausibly measurable, and it is that which we define as data. Our data are a simplification of the messy, complex world from which they were derived.  There are different approximations of “plausibly measurable”. Hence, datasets are always the result of choices. We must decide whether they are nonetheless reasonable for the task at hand. We use statistical models to help us think deeply about, explore, and hopefully come to better understand, our data. (Alexander 2023)"

    "text": "How Do Our Worlds Become Data?\n Through skillfulreduction 👨‍🍳\n\nJust as a chef reduces a rich sauce to concentrate its essential flavors, we simplify reality into data—plausibly measurable approximations that capture the essence of the complex world. This reduction process involves deliberate choices about what aspects of reality to include, much like deciding which ingredients to emphasize in a culinary reduction. Our datasets, therefore, are distilled versions of reality, highlighting specific components while inevitably leaving out others.\nAs we employ statistical models to explore and understand these datasets, it’s crucial to recognize both what the data include and what they omit. Similar to how a reduction in cooking intensifies certain flavors while others may be lost or muted, the process of data simplification can inadvertently exclude important nuances or perspectives. Particularly in data science, where human-generated data are prevalent, we must consider who or what is systematically missing from our datasets. Some individuals or phenomena may not fit neatly into our chosen methods and might be oversimplified or excluded entirely. The abstraction and simplification inherent in turning the world into data require careful judgment—much like a chef monitoring a reduction to achieve the desired consistency without overcooking—to determine when simplification is appropriate and when it risks losing critical information.\nMeasurement itself presents significant challenges, and those deeply involved in the data collection process often have less trust in the data than those removed from it. Just as the process of reducing a sauce demands constant attention to prevent burning or altering the intended flavor, converting the world into data involves numerous decisions and potential errors—from selecting what to measure to deciding on the methods and accuracy required. Advances in instruments—from telescopes in astronomy to real-time internet data collection—have expanded our ability to gather data, much like new culinary techniques enhance a chef’s ability to create complex dishes. However, the world still imperfectly becomes data, and to truly learn from it, we must actively seek to understand the imperfections in our datasets and consider how our “reduction” process may have altered or omitted important aspects of reality."

For example, simulating an age-group variable with specific categories allows us to test the real data for consistency. Simulation is also vital for validating statistical models; by applying models to data with known properties, we can ensure they perform as intended before using them on real data.

As we delve deeper, each question we pose tends to generate additional questions, leading to continual improvement and refinement of our understanding. This iterative questioning contrasts with the traditional Popperian approach of fixed hypothesis testing often taught quantitative methods courses in the sciences; instead, questions evolve continuously throughout the exploration. Finding an initial research question can be challenging, especially when attempting to operationalize it into measurable and available variables.\nStrategies to overcome this include selecting an area of genuine interest, sketching broad claims that can be honed into specific questions, and combining insights from different fields. Developing comfort with the inherent messiness of real-world data allows us to ask new questions as the data evolve. Knowing a dataset in detail often reveals unexpected patterns or anomalies, which we can explore further with subject-matter experts. Becoming a “hybrid”—cultivating knowledge across various disciplines—and being comfortable with asking seemingly simple or “dumb” questions are particularly valuable in enhancing our understanding and fostering meaningful insights."

This process is challenging because even seemingly simple measurements, like a person’s height, can vary based on factors like the time of day or the tools used (e.g., tape measure versus laser), making consistent comparison difficult and often unfeasible. The difficulty intensifies with more abstract concepts such as sadness or pain, where defining and measuring them consistently is even more problematic. This reduction of the world into data is not value-free; it requires critical decisions about what to measure, how to measure it, and what to ignore, all influenced by context and purpose. Like Picasso’s minimalist drawings that capture the essence of a dog but lack details necessary for specific assessments (e.g., determining if the dog is sick), we must deeply understand and respect what we’re measuring, carefully deciding which features are essential and which can be stripped away to serve our research objectives."

EDA requires a variety of skills and never truly finishes, as there’s always more to explore.

Statistics is not merely a collection of dry theorems and proofs; it’s a way of exploring and understanding the world. A statistical model is not a rigid recipe to follow mechanically but a tool for making sense of data. Modeling is usually required to infer statistical patterns, formally known as statistical inference—the process of using data to infer the distribution that generated them. Importantly, statistical significance does not equate to scientific significance, and relying on arbitrary pass/fail tests is rarely appropriate. Instead, we should use statistical modeling as a form of echolocation, listening to what the models tell us about the shape of the world while recognizing that they offer just one representation of reality."

This reduction process involves deliberate choices about what aspects of reality to include, much like deciding which ingredients to emphasize in a culinary reduction. Our datasets, therefore, are distilled versions of reality, highlighting specific components while inevitably leaving out others.\nAs we employ statistical models to explore and understand these datasets, it’s crucial to recognize both what the data include and what they omit. Similar to how a reduction in cooking intensifies certain flavors while others may be lost or muted, the process of data simplification can inadvertently exclude important nuances or perspectives. Particularly in data science, where human-generated data are prevalent, we must consider who or what is systematically missing from our datasets. Some individuals or phenomena may not fit neatly into our chosen methods and might be oversimplified or excluded entirely. The abstraction and simplification inherent in turning the world into data require careful judgment—much like a chef monitoring a reduction to achieve the desired consistency without overcooking—to determine when simplification is appropriate and when it risks losing critical information.\nMeasurement itself presents significant challenges, and those deeply involved in the data collection process often have less trust in the data than those removed from it. Just as the process of reducing a sauce demands constant attention to prevent burning or altering the intended flavor, converting the world into data involves numerous decisions and potential errors—from selecting what to measure to deciding on the methods and accuracy required. Advances in instruments—from telescopes in astronomy to real-time internet data collection—have expanded our ability to gather data, much like new culinary techniques enhance a chef’s ability to create complex dishes. However, the world still imperfectly becomes data, and to truly learn from it, we must actively seek to understand the imperfections in our datasets and consider how our “reduction” process may have altered or omitted important aspects of reality."

CP-2003 (Chemistry-Physics, Computer Lab) When is class? Tuesdays & Thursdays, 1:30 - 2:50 pm Office Hours: A4054, Tuesdays & Thursdays, 3:00 - 4:00 pm\n\nSOCI 3040, Quantitative Research Methods, will familiarize students with the procedures for understanding and conducting quantitative social science research. It will introduce students to the quantitative research process, hypothesis development and testing, and the application of appropriate tools for analyzing quantitative data. All sections of this course count towards the HSS Quantitative Reasoning Requirement (see mun.ca/hss/qr). (PR: SOCI 1000 or the former SOCI 2000)\n\n\n\n\n👋 Hello!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course is built around Rohan Alexander’s (2023) Telling Stories with Data.\n\n\nThis section of SOCI 3440 is an introduction to quantitative research methods, from planning an analysis to sharing the final results. Following the workflow from Rohan Alexander’s (2023) Telling Stories with Data, you will learn how to:\n\nplan an analysis and sketch your data and endpoint\nsimulate some data to “force you into the details”\nacquire, assess, and prepare empirical data for analysis\nexplore and analyze data by creating visualizations and fitting models\nshare the results of your work with the world!\n\nYou will use this workflow in the context of learning foundational quantitative research skills, including conducting exploratory data analyses and fitting, assessing, and interpreting linear and generalized linear models. Reproducibility and research ethics are considered throughout the workflow, and the entire course.\n\n\nAbout the Instructor\nJohn McLevey (he/him) Pronounced like mic-Leave-ee\n\n\nLand Acknowledgement\nWe acknowledge that the lands on which Memorial University’s campuses are situated are in the traditional territories of diverse Indigenous groups, and we acknowledge with respect the diverse histories and cultures of the Beothuk, Mi’kmaq, Innu, and Inuit of this province.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAlexander, Rohan. 2023.
