This section of SOCI 3440 is an introduction to **quantitative research methods**, from planning an analysis to sharing the final results. Following the workflow from Rohan Alexander's (2023) *[Telling Stories with Data](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com)*, you will learn how to:

1. **plan** an analysis and sketch your data and endpoint 
2. **simulate** some data to "force you into the details"
3. **acquire**, assess, and prepare empirical data for analysis
4. **explore** and analyze data by creating visualizations and fitting models
5. **share** the results of your work with the world!

You will use this workflow in the context of learning foundational quantitative research skills, including conducting **exploratory data analyses** and fitting, assessing, and interpreting **linear models**, **generalized linear models**, and **multilevel models**. Reproducibility and research ethics are considered throughout the workflow, and the entire course.
