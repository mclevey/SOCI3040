# {{< bi laptop >}}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computing 

Detailed information about computing in this course is available [here](computing.qmd).

You will learn to use **R** (a free/open source programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics) and **Quarto** (a free/open source publishing system for creating dynamic and reproducible manuscripts, reports, websites, and presentations) in this course. Note that **I assume no prior experience** with R or Quarto. Everything you need to know about both will be introduced in the course. While some prior programming experience is an asset, it is by no means necessary.
